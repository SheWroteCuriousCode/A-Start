# A-Start
Just a fresher's attempt to code
I'm just another human being trying to make some sense out of code. I'm taken by surprise because I never really imagined that I'll have my own repository on github someday :p I've been in an on and off relationship with Java and Python. My coursework in Biotechnology is to blame for that. But I do realise the importance of open source projects and the need to save my work somewhere finally. I hope I've come to the right place. :')
